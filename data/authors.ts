I didn't want to give up, so I watched some youtube videos about the book, and so I began to understand his writings and philosophy.",

        desc: "I do not recall when I heard about Jung. I always knew his name but I thought he was a philosopher. I grew interest in him after reading “Man and His Symbols”, which he wrote in his last years. I was skeptical at first about his theories about dreams but after reading this book his ideas made a lot of sense to me. Carl Jung thought that a dream was a bridge between the conscious and unconscious mind, away the unconscious to communicate.",
